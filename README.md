### About

I am a PhD student in Statistics at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. My current research focuses on flexible hypothesis tests based on Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models. I am also interested in the efficient implementation of new imputation methodologies based on large-scale convex optimization problems.

In the past, I also worked on impact evaluation. Specifically on the efficient implementation of novel matching estimators.
